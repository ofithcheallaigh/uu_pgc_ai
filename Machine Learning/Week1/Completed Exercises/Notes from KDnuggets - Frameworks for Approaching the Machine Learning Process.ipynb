    "\n",
    "The two most recent resources which outline frameworks for appraoching the process of machine learning are Yifeng Gou's [The 7 Stepos of Machine Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-7-steps-of-machine-learning-2877d7e5548e) and section 4.5 of Francois Chollet's [Deep learning with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet/dp/1617294438).\n",

    "## The 7 Steps of Machine Leaning\n",
    "Guo laid out the steps as follows:\n",
    "1. Data Collection\n",
    "    * The quantyity and quality of your data dictate how accurate our model is\n",
    "    * The outcome of this step is generally a representation of data (Gou simplifies to specifying a table) which we will use for training\n",
    "    * using pre-collected data, by way of datasets from Kaggle, UCI, etc., still fits into this step   \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Data Preparation\n",
    "    * Wrangle data and prepare it for training\n",
    "    * Clean that which may require it (remove duplicates, correct errors, deal with missing values, normalisation, data type conversions, etc.)\n",
    "    * Randomise data, which erases the effects of the particular order in which we collect and/or otherwise prepare our data\n",
    "    * Visualise data to help detect relavent relationships betweem cariables or class imbalances (bias alert), or preform other exploratory analysis\n",
    "    * Split into training and exaluation sets\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Choose a model\n",
    "    * Different algorithms are for different tasks; choose the right one\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Train the model\n",
    "    * The goal of training is to answer a question or make a prediction"
