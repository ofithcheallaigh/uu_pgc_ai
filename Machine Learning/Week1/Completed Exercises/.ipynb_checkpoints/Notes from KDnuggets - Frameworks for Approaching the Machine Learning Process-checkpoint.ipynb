    "## The 7 Steps of Machine Leaning\n",
    "Guo laid out the steps as follows:\n",
    "1. Data Collection\n",
    "    * The quantyity and quality of your data dictate how accurate our model is\n",
    "    * The outcome of this step is generally a representation of data (Gou simplifies to specifying a table) which we will use for training\n",
    "    * using pre-collected data, by way of datasets from Kaggle, UCI, etc., still fits into this step   \n",

    "2. Data Preparation\n",
