    "**If you have previously programmed in Python or used Jupyter notebooks before, you may not need to complete this notebook. In that case, please move onto Lab Exercise 1.1**\n",
    "\n",
    "This file is an example of a Jupyter Notebook. It is a document that can contain both live code (in COM761, the code will be Python) and text, as well as visualizations, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "We need to distinguish between different types of cells. This cell is a **Markdown cell** whereas the next cell below is a **Code cell**. Markdown cells are for formatting text rather than for running code. To see how to format headings, use italics and bold font, for example, you can go into edit mode by double-clicking on a cell. Try it for this cell. To execute the cell (and so produce the formatted text), you can go to *Cell / Run Cells* or use the shortcut *Ctrl-Enter*. (You can find other keyboard shortcuts under the *Help* menu.) Markdown is very useful for mathematical notation such as $\\sqrt{2}$. For further details on Markdown see <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/markdown-in-jupyter-notebook\" >Markdown in Jupyter Notebook</a>.\n",

    "You should try out a few other calculations like the one above. To do this, you have a few options. You can edit a current cell, such as the one above, to do a different calculation, but it is better to insert a new cell. You can do this by a) clicking on the cell above and then clicking *Insert / Insert Cell Below* from the menu or b) when executing a cell you can click *Cell / Run Cells and Insert Cell Below* from the menu (or alternatively use the shortcut *Alt-Enter*).\n",

    "You should try these out in the Code cell below, using the `print` function to display output. For example, to print the output from the previous cell we could use `print((25 - 4.5**2) / 3) `. However you should also format the output to 3 decimal places. Hint: one way to do this is to use the `format` function as follows `print('{:X.Yf}'.format(1.234567))` where X and Y need to be replaced by suitable integers.

    "You will have noticed that when you run a cell, a number appears beside it at the left hand side. These show us the order in which the cells have been executed. Unlike a typical program, the code does not have to be executed in a particular order. Consider the following three cells. If you execute them in order, the value of x displayed by the second cell is the value specified in the first of the three cells, i.e. 5, as you would expect. But suppose you execute the second of these cells after you execute the third one, you will find that the value of x displayed is 10.\n",
